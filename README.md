# Flimflam Core UI Demo

This is a demo page for the Flimflam Core UI components whose source can be found at [flimflamjs/ff-core](https://github.com/flimflamjs/ff-core).

It pulls the components and basic css from the [flimflam](https://github.com/flimflamjs/flimflam) meta-package.

## development

Run the dev server with `npm run dev`

Build and watch the css with `npm run css`

Build the distribution files with `npm run build`

To publish the distribution, cd into `dist/` after building, and set it to track the remote github branch `gh-pages`.
